# Pigeon messenger

Pigeon messenger is a simple cloud-based messaging app.

Your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your devices, so you will not lose any of your data when you change your mobile phone or re-install the app.

Pigeon uses your phone number for authentication. You can send messages, photos and videos to people who are in your phone contacts and have Pigeon, or you can store data in the cloud, by sending messages to yourself.
